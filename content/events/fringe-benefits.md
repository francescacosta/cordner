**Do you have employees?**



Then you will no doubt be providing benefits to them



Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) may be payable by employers on certain benefits provided to employees (including directors), their families and associates



FBT can even apply to an employer if the benefit is provided by a third party to an employee due to the associate relationship



If you think that this broad tax regime may apply to your circumstances, then you need to be aware of itâ€™s possible impact on your business



We invite you to join us for the next session in our



Business Advisory Breakfast Series



Enjoy breakfast on us and tune in to an informative session on how FBT may apply to you

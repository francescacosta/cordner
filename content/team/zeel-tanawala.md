I have done Master of Business (Specializing in Professional Accounting) From the Queensland University of Technology. Along with having overseas experience in the insurance industry, during my studies I have worked with local Australian firms gaining experience in taxation compliance, bookkeeping, and payroll. 

I have recently joined Cordner Advisory and am widening my knowledge in the area of Financial Reporting and Financial Analysis. I am now working towards a Graduate Diploma of Chartered Accounting from Chartered Accountant Australia & New-Zealand

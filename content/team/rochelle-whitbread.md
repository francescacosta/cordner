Rochelle recently joined us after relocating from her home town in regional NSW. She has been working in the accounting industry for almost five years, with extensive experience in all things Cloud. Since completing her Graduate Diploma of Chartered Accounting (GradDipCA) from CAANZ, her newly found freedom has seen her enjoying the beautiful beaches with coffee and book in hand.

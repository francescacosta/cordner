Cordner Advisory help identify state and federal government funding opportunities for business just like yours and we have extensive experience preparing grant, incentives and entitlement applications.​

​Government grant and funding opportunities are in many cases deemed to be an entitlement or subject to a competitive grants program. Common grants/entitlements for businesses include ​Export Marketing Development Grant (EMDG)​, ​Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive​ and Innovation Grants​.

If you meet the relevant eligibility criteria you will receive the entitlements or be assessed amongst competitors for suitability.

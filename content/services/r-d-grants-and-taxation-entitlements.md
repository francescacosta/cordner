The Australian Government (Federal and State) provide numerous grants opportunities relating to innovation which contribute funding support for your business for specific projects and functions. These grants are available throughout all stages of your business lifecycle.

​Government grant and funding opportunities are in many cases deemed to be an entitlement or subject to a competitive grants program. Common grants/entitlements for businesses include ​Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive​ and ​Export Marketing Development Grants (EMDG)​.

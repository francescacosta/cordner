We are focussed on securing and growing assets. When is the appropriate time to start the planning process? The answer is simple – now! Before you have a structuring problem. Before you have a tax problem. Before you have a retirement affordability problem. Before you have a health problem. Before...

Structuring​ is a key element for ​wealth creation​, ​tax planning​ and a​sset protection​. Cordner Advisory help you grow and protect your wealth by structuring your affairs in a practical and tailored manner.

<br />

Switching assets from one structure to another can be onerous and costly, therefore ensuring the asset in the right structure at the outset is of critical importance. This includes your family home and other personal assets, your business assets, intellectual property, investment assets, your business itself and so on.
Self-Managed Superannuation Funds​ are an important vehicle to grow your wealth in a tax effective way - strategy and compliance of SMSFs is vital to the overall of success of your SMSF and we work closely with you to achieve the best outcomes for your SMSF.
In order to ​minimise your tax​ we recommend structures that you can put in place that are the most tax effective for your individual tailored circumstances, why pay more tax than what is legislated?

<br />

We ensure that your wealth is passed to your chosen beneficiaries in the most secure and effective manner through comprehensive ​succession and estate planning​. We review the required steps for each of the structures you have – your business, your investment structures, your superannuation, your insurances, as well as your Will and Power(s) of Attorney.
We work to deliver integrated, independent harmonised solutions through close collaboration with your trusted advisors such as bankers, financial planners, lawyers, brokers and other advisors via our ​Family Office Services​. We provide compliance and taxation services to ensure that your ATO and ASIC compliance obligations are met.

<br />

We attend to your financial reporting requirements including budgets, cashflow and P&L reports. We also provide administrative support services such as mail service, bill approval, payments and important correspondence.
As with all private advisory, other important considerations such as Insurance, Smart Investment Decisions, SMSFs are key ingredients that can help to secure and grow your wealth.

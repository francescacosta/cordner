Given the level of uncertainty we're confronting and the rapid deployment of stimulus and other financial responses to the crisis, we will commit to regularly updating our community - taking the news headlines, fact checking them where possible on putting them in to context of what they mean for people and how they can access any available assistance.

Unfortunately, sometimes the position will be 'watch this space' as all the media have to go on is a press release or announcement, with real details on implementation to follow later.

We will monitor all such situations and let you know as and when specifics come to hand.

The Governments lucrative early investor tax incentive called the Early Stage Innovation Company (ESIC) scheme allow investors to claim non – refundable carry forward tax offsets and exemptions on CGT dependent upon meeting certain criteria.

**What is an ESIC?**

To qualify as an ESIC there are several criteria that a company must first satisfy. To be eligible for the tax incentives the company must:

* Have been incorporated in Australia within the last 3 income years
    o	This is extended to the last 6 income years if the company and its 100% owned subsidiaries incurred total expenses of $1million or less 
* Registered in the Australian Business Register within the last 3 income years
* Have total expenses of $1million or less in the income year before the current year
* Have total assessable income of $200k or less in the income year before the current year
* Have no equity interests listed on an official stock exchange 
* Meet the [**100-point innovation test or the principles-based innovation test**](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Tax-incentives-for-innovation/In-detail/Tax-incentives-for-early-stage-investors/?page=2)

**Who is Eligible?**

The tax concessions do come with the caveat that the investments must be made by a sophisticated investor. A sophisticated investor is an investor who has had a gross annual income of $250,000 or more in each of the previous two years or has net assets of at least $2.5 million. 

**Investment Criteria:**

For the investor to be eligible for the tax incentives the investment must satisfy several requirements. 

* Trust / Partnerships excluded themselves, though individual members are not
* Widely held companies and their 100% owned subsidiaries excluded
* Equity interest that are shares must have been issued directly from the ESIC. 
    o	Preference shares and debt investments are not covered. 
    o	Convertible notes can be considered eligible granted that they satisfy the ESIC conditions and that they satisfy such criteria when the notes are converted into shares.
* The company must be an ESIC
* Investor cannot be an affiliate of the company 
* Acquisition is not an employee share scheme interest issued under an employee share scheme 
* Investor holds ≤ 30% of equity interest in the company and its connected entities

**What are the Incentives?**

Investors who satisfy the criteria are eligible to receive a non – refundable carry forward tax offset of 20% of the amount paid by the investor in purchasing the shares (this amount is capped at $200k in each income year). An eligible investor is also eligible for an exemption on any capital gains on those shares if they are continuously held for a minimum of 12 months but less than 10 years, the capital loss on such ownership is disregarded granted the shares are held within this period.

**Concessional and Non-Concessional Contribution Caps**

From 1 July 2021, the concessional and non-concessional contribution caps are set to increase due to indexation for the first time ever since July 2017.

The concessional contribution cap, originally set at $25,000 from 1 July 2017, is indexed by average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) in increments of $2,500.

With the announcement of the AWOTE figure for the December 2020 quarter, the concessional contribution cap is set to increase from $25,000 p.a. to $27,500 p.a. from 1 July 2021.

The non-concessional cap in 2021–22 will see the standard cap increased from $100,000 to $110,000 from this date.

In addition, the maximum amount a member who was under 65 at the start of the year can contribute under the non-concessional contribution cap bring-forward rule is also set to increase from $300,000 to $330,000 from 1 July 2021.

**Transfer Balance Account**

Also increasing on 1 July 2021 is the Transfer Balance Cap. It is increasing by $100,000 to $1.7m.

This increase will impact both people in and/or about to enter retirement phase as well as people who are considering escalating their contributions in the near future.

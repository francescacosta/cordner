Many social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are becoming a must have for small business. Talking about Instagram as an example, Australia has 9,000,000 monthly active Instagram users, around 40 per cent of the total population, so there’s a very good chance of reaching a small business’s potential customers via the platform. 68 per cent of Instagrammers engage with brands regularly, and Instagram provides 58 times more engagement per follower than Facebook, so the business case for Instagram is very strong.

**

If anyone has ever been unsure of what you have to offer, or simply don’t have the time or attention to read large amount of content on the website or phone the business, the users can straight away visit your Facebook page or Instagram to get a quick snapshot of what you are offering. By showcasing your business through photography or by posting exciting information people can quickly see what makes your business and its products unique and will be tempted to be a part of it.

**

Being on social media allows your clients to rate your business for the type of work you are currently performing for them or have performed in the past.

This opens new opportunities to get many new customers and further get higher ratings to show the quality of work performed.

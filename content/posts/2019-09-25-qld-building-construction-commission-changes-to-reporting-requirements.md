In 2014, the reporting requirements for licensees were reduced and since this reduction in compliance has been in place, the QBCC has had to deal with numerous high-profile insolvencies.

Additionally, there have been a number of phoenixing activities which have come to light, further requiring the QBCC to tighten its controls and reporting, in addition to sharing data with the ATO and ASIC to try and put a halt to these arrangements.

From 01 January 2019, these new laws that strengthen the Minimum Financial Requirements (MFR) of all Licence Holders in the construction industry have come into effect to :-

1.	Better monitor licensees financial situations

2.	Take appropriate action where a licensee may not be operating a financially sustainable business

3.	To mitigate the effects of potential insolvencies and corporate collapses, better protecting end users and subcontractors

The new system was implemented in January 2019, after industry consultation in late 2018, commencing with Phase 1 requiring the **Cat 4-7** Licensees to report by **31 March 2019**.  Phase 2 commenced immediately after this on 02 April 2019, detailing the requirements for **SC1-2 and Cat 1-3** reporting due by **31 December 2019**. 

There are a number of self reporting options via the QBCC Online Portal, however the variables in reporting requirements and the onerous nature of getting the report wrong, would encourage a conversation with us to ensure compliance is achieved.

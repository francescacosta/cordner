The Federal Government has recently approved the proposed changes to the small business CGT concessions available to taxpayers on the 20th September 2018. These changes were initially announced in the May 2017 budget handed down but are now drastically different to when they were first put forward, and not in favour of the taxpayers.

The new bill aims to improve a number of integrity measures for small business owners selling their ventures, including laws making it more difficult to access any of the four CGT concessions currently available. A summary of the new requirements includes, but is not limited to;

**Active asset test
**

* CGT assets must have been active for at least half of the period of ownership.
* Shares or Units in a trust will only be considered active assets is more than 80% of the entityâ€™s assets are active. Financial instruments and cash are now excluded unless they take on the characteristics of trading stock

**The entity holding the CGT asset
**

* Turnover less than $2 million, or;
* Net assets less than $6 million.
* The taxpayer must be carrying on a business just before the time the CGT event occurs

**The Object Entity
**

* Must also be carrying on a business at the time the CGT event occurs.
* Satisfy the SBE turnover tests of income less than $2 million, or net assets less than $6 million.
* Controlling interest in other entities with a shareholding greater than 20% are aggregated for the minimum net asset value

These changes are retrospective to  the 8th February 2018 and if you feel they may apply to your situation, please feel free to contact one of our trusted advisors here at Cordner Advisory on (07) 5504 5700.

As we approach 30 June, there are a few things to remember… and check… when it comes to superannuation contributions.

**Concessional Contributions
**

These are the contributions paid to a super fund for which a tax deduction will be claimed. (Typically, Employer Contributions and Personal Deductible Contributions).

If you are under 65 – Between you and you employer, a maximum of $25,000 can be contributed this year. 

**Note: **you can top up your employer contributions with any amount up to a total of $25,000. The 10% rule, that prevented this in the past, has been scrapped. If this is of interest to you, call us for more details.

If you are 65 or over – you must meet a work test before a super fund can accept contributions on your behalf (other than super guarantee payments, of course). You must have been gainfully employed for a period of 40 hours in a consecutive 30-day period. 

If you pass the work test, concessional contributions of up to $25,000 can be made on your behalf. If you are unsure and wish to speak to someone before making a contribution, do not hesitate to contact us.

**Non-concessional Contributions
**

These are the contributions for which no deduction is claimed.

The annual non-concessional contributions cap is $100,000.

The 3-year bring forward provisions mean that some people may be able to contribute up to $300,000 (and forgo making further non-concessional contributions in the following 2 years)

**But wait, there are rules
**

If you are over 65, you must meet the work test as described for Concessional Contributions above. If you meet a work test, the maximum you may be able to contribute is $100,000 (the 3-year bring forward provisions are not available to you).

Your Total Superannuation Balance also plays a role in determining whether you can make non-concessional contributions.

If your Total Superannuation Balance at 30 June 2018 was more than $1.6million – you cannot make any non-concessional contributions this year.

If your Total Superannuation Balance at 30 June 2018 was between $1.5million and $1.6million, you can make a maximum amount of $100,000 non-concessional contributions (regardless of your age but remembering the work test for those over 65).

If your Total Superannuation Balance is between $1.4million and $1.5million, and you are under the age of 65, you can make non-concessional contributions of $200,000 (2-years’ worth of non-concessional contributions).

If your Total Superannuation Balance is below $1.4million, and you are under the age of 65, you can make non-concessional contributions of $300,000 (3-years’ worth of non-concessional contributions.

This is, of course, dependent on you not having triggered the 3-year bring forward rule at some time during the 2016-17 or 2017-18 financial years.

**Simple.
**

Of course, you should always check, check, check… there may well be a technicality, exception or circumstance which may prevent or allow you to make non-concessional contributions. Please call us to discuss this, if you are uncertain.

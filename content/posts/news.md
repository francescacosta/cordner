According to official records, there is still $17.5 billion in lost and unclaimed super waiting to be found. Some of it could belong to you or your employees.

People can lose track of their super when they change their name, address or job, or live overseas – things many people have done at some point in their lives.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has just released data showing the amount of lost and unclaimed super that’s waiting to be found in each postcode across Australia. Someone in Tasmania is missing more than $220,000 of their super! Imagine how much that would help one of your employees in their retirement!

Let your employees know they can keep track of their super using myGov. They can find out how to manage their super, including how to find lost super, by visiting [Keeping track of your super

**Do you have apprentices and trainees?**

**Wage subsidy for of 50% of an eligible apprentice or trainee’s wage**

If you have apprentices or trainees, you may be eligible to apply for a wage subsidy under the JobTrainer package, introduced by the government. 

Your small business may be eligible for subsidy relating to wages between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 if:

* You have fewer than 20 employees
* You are using a Group Training Organisation
* The apprentice or training was undertaking an Australian Apprenticeship with you on 1 July 2020

Your medium-sized business may now be eligible for subsidy relating to wages between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 if:

* You have fewer than 200 employees
* You are using a Group Training Organisation
* The apprentice or training was undertaking an Australian Apprenticeship with you on 1 July 2020

Subsidies will also be available to any new employer who re-engages an eligible apprentice that was displaced by an eligible small or medium sized business.

According to the Australian Government, Department of Education, Skills and Employment, ‘Eligible employers will receive a wage subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the wages paid worth up to $7,000 per quarter, per eligible apprentice or trainee, reimbursed in arrears.’

For further information on eligibility and how to apply, you may contact an Australian Apprenticeship Support Network provider:

Kick-start the new year and work smarter by improving your organisationâ€™s digital capability with the help from the government via the [Small Business Digital Grant Program](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/starting-business/advice-support/grants/digital-grants). We are inviting five small businesses to register their interest and work with us to secure this grant. Our technology partner [Effectus Digital](https://www.effectusdigital.com.au/), who will work with you to ensure solid returns of your technology investments.

Some examples where you could utilise the grant money will be to do either of below: 

* a detailed discovery of your current systems and processes to look for efficiencies and help you in replacing legacy systems,
* gain flexibility to work from anywhere with by migrating to the cloud.
* get a fresh and modern looking website & branding upgrades including online payment capability if required, or
* Secure your documents and systems having a detailed look at your security posture.

**How much can you apply for and what can it be used for?
**

If the application is successful, matched funding of up to $10,000 (excluding GST) is available for the purchase of hardware, software and services (such as digital coaching). The minimum grant funding amount is $1,000. Reimbursement will occur after submission of supplier invoices and proof of purchase/s. 

Such acquisitions cannot be made (in full or in part) until a business has proven that the proposed digital technology/service will improve the digital capabilities, employment growth and competitiveness of their business. 

**Is your business eligible?**

To be eligible the business must:

* Have less than 20 employees at the time of application
* Have an ABN and be GST registered
* Have a head office in Queensland
* Have made up to a maximum turnover of $2million in the last financial year
* Not be insolvent or have owners/directors that are an undischarged bankrupt
* Be able to afford up front payment of the approved products/services in full. 

Note that only 1 application will be accepted from an individual ABN or a financial beneficiary of a business and successful applicants cannot reapply for future funding under this grant.

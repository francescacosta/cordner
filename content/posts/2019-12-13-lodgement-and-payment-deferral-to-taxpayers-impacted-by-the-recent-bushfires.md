Due to the recent catastrophic bushfires in QLD and NSW, the ATO has granted a two-month lodgement and payment deferral for taxpayers in affected areas. The extension has been applied automatically, so there is no need for taxpayers to do anything. 


The extension applies as follows:

* Quarterly Business Activity Statements (BAS) otherwise due in November 2019 are now due 28 January 2020
* Monthly BAS otherwise due in November 2019 are now due 28 January 2020
* Income tax for individuals resulting from lodgement of the FY 2019 tax return is now due for payment 21 January 2020 instead of 21 November

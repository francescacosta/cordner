The Federal Government has unveiled its HomeBuilder scheme, which has been designed to help Australia’s Residential Construction Industry bounce back from the Corona Virus crisis.

The package will see eligible owner-occupiers (including first home buyers) who are either building or undertaking substantial renovations, paid a non-taxable grant of $25,000 for doing so.

HomeBuilder will apply to construction contracts which are in place and signed between 04th June 2020 and 31st December 2020, with work to be commenced within 3 months of the contract date.

Whether you’re starting out in business or have many years under your belt, it is never too soon or too late to review your trading structure options. In many cases, if set up correctly early on it can save much heartache or unnecessary tax burdens down the track and help you on your path to achieving your goals.

The most contemporary structures we come across in accounting today are companies and trusts or a combination of both. Used correctly, they can be an effective tool to;

Mitigate tax liabilities – availability to access corporate tax rates (27.5% for small businesses and 30% for all other) and potentially the flexibility to distribute income reducing the overall tax payable.

Protect your assets – it is always a good idea to separate business and personal assets. In some cases, even separating business only assets can be advantageous such as Australian real property, intellectual property, licences and even employees.

Simplify operations – if there are many facets to your business, it may be beneficial to segregate these for reasons such as reporting, compliance, valuations and the sale of certain business functions to third parties.

Fortunately, the ATO understands that businesses do change over time and can “outgrow” a structure. For this they provide income and capital gain tax relief for small businesses looking to restructure with turnovers of less than $10 million. The main condition to be satisfied is that the ultimate economic ownership of the assets transferred does not change through the rollover.

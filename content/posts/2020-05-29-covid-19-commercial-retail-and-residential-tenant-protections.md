**Eviction Freezes**

Each state or territory has implemented eviction freezes for tenants in rental arrears that are suffering financial hardship because of COVID-19. Note in certain cases, evictions may be still enacted on successful application with the relevant state/territory tenancy authority. 

**QLD** – A landlord cannot evict an eligible tenant during 29 March to 29 September 2020 and they must offer an extension to a lease ending for a minimum of 6-months.

**VIC** – Evictions prohibited between 29 March and 26 September 2020 for eligible tenants.

**WA** – 6-month stop on evictions from 30 March to 29 September 2020. Periodic lease agreements are to take effect for those leases expiring during the period unless a new agreement is entered, or tenant terminates. 

**TAS** – 120-day suspension from 27 March to 25 July 2020 on evictions for rental arrears and broader ban on evictions until 30 June 2020. Further extensions may be announced at the state governments discretion.  

**ACT** – Evictions prohibited for 3-months from 22 April to 22 July 2020 for eligible tenants. A further 3-month extension may be announced at the state governments discretion.

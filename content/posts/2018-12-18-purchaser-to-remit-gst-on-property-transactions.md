 The ATO has recently announced changes to the GST laws for property developers to improve the integrity on property transactions. The changes will come into effect from 01 July 2018 and are mainly focusing on developers not correctly remitting GST on eligible sales of new residential premises or subdivisions.

From this date, the purchasers of new residential premises or subdivided land will be required to remit 1/11th of the sale price directly to the ATO.  If the developer is applying the margin scheme, the amount payable drops to a flat rate of 7% with provisions in place for the Commissioner of Taxation to vary the rate up to a maximum of 9%.

This GST payment will be due on or before settlement, with the vendor to provide details to purchasers at least 14 days prior to the supply being made. Generally, the vendor must provide the following;

* The name and ABN of the entity making the supply (the vendor)
* The amount of GST the purchaser must pay to the Commissioner
* When this payment must be made

As you can probably imagine, the payment of GST by the purchasers may cause some cash flow timing issues. GST is payable on or before the day that consideration for the supply is first made, with deposit payments being excluded for the timing of GST payments. The ATO is of the belief that this creates an incentive for developers to structure contracts in a way that benefits the purchaser.

The above changes can have the following implications on property developers:

**Cash-Flow implications**

* Developers will no longer have temporary access to the GST amount of a purchase price following settlement. The new legislation, will result in the supplier receiving the consideration for the property net of an amount representing the GST. Therefore, a supplier, such as a property developer, will not receive the full consideration as they do currently, because an amount representing an estimate of the GST will have been withheld by the purchaser to be paid directly to the ATO. This may also have implications for bank funding arrangements.

**Refunds and Tax Credits**

* Developers lodging their Business Activity Statement (“BAS”) on a quarterly basis may be entitled to obtain a refund in situations where:
* there has effectively been an ‘overpayment’ of GST. This may occur in the context of margin scheme sales, as the GST required to be paid based on the margin scheme will be less than the amount that the purchaser should have remitted to the ATO; and
* a purchaser remits GST in error or remits an incorrect amount.

However, developers lodging their BAS on a monthly basis will only be eligible for the credit on lodgement of their BAS and not via a separate application process.

In preparation for these changes, developers may wish to consider amending their contracts and systems to ensure compliance with the new regime. This may include incorporating their notice obligations into all contracts of sale. Contracts entered in to prior to 1 July 2018 are excluded from these provisions under the condition that settlement occurs within two years (1 July 2020).

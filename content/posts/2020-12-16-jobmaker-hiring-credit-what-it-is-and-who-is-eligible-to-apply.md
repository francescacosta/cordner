The JobMaker Hiring Credit was introduced by the Australian Government to provide incentive for employers to hire young job seekers by delivering a payment to employers to help support the new employee’s wages cost.


The scheme will see eligible employers to be able to access up to $200 per week for each eligible additional employee aged 16 to 29 years, and up to $100 per week for each eligible additional employee aged 30 to 35 years.



**What are the eligibility rules?**


_**For Employees**_

The new employee must:

* Be aged between 16 to 35 years at the start of their employment.
* Have received the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance or Parenting Payment for at least for at least 28 consecutive days within the 84 days prior to being employed in their new position.
* Have worked at least 20 paid hours per week on average for the full weeks they were employed during the reporting period.
* Complete an employee notice for JobMaker Hiring Credit supplied by their employer.
* Have not completed a JobMaker employee notice for another employer they are still working for.


**The employee must not:**

* Be an employee for whom the employer is receiving another Commonwealth wage subsidy such as an apprenticeship or traineeship wage subsidy.
* Be an employee for whom another employer is claiming JobMaker Hiring Credit.

_**For Employers**_


The employer must:

* Have an Australian Business Number (ABN).
* Be registered for pay as you go (PAYG) withholding.

* Claim the credit in respect of an eligible employee.
* Have kept adequate records of paid hours worked by the eligible employee.

* Increase both their total employee headcount from 30 September 2020 and increase their payroll for the reporting period (7 October 2020 to 6 October 2021) compared to the three months to 6 October 2020.
